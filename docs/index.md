Mapzen.js is an open-source JavaScript SDK and an extension of [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) for making maps for the web and mobile devices. Mapzen.js simplifies the process of using Mapzen's maps within Leaflet.

Mapzen.js contains all the Leaflet functionality, as well as additional tools for working with Mapzen maps and search. With Mapzen.js you can add [Mapzen map styles](https://mapzen.com/products/maps/) as basemaps, build a customizable geocoder with [Mapzen Search](https://mapzen.com/products/search/), and share links to maps.
