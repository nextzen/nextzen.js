Mapzen.js is an open-source JavaScript SDK and an extension of [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) for making maps on the web. The Leaflet JavaScript library provides tools for building an interactive map for web and mobile devices. Leaflet is extensible, and developers have built additional tools for Leaflet maps.

This library offers the full extent of the Leaflet library with additional functions to make using Mapzen tools as simple as possible. With Mapzen.js you can add [Mapzen House Styles]() as a basemap, build a customizable geocoder with [Mapzen Search](https://mapzen.com/products/search/), and can create fragment URLs to be able to share the exact map instance with someone.
